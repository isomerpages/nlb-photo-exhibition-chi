Laid out in the 1820s, the Esplanade referred to the extensive open field known as the Padang, and the shoreline that fronts the sea. The public space was used for military exercises, ceremonies and recreation. Apart from being a playing field for cricket and rugby, the Esplanade in the 19th Century was also a hub for social life where people would gather for leisure, enjoy their evening strolls or rides in open horse-drawn carriages.
