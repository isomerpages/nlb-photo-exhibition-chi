In the 1820s, Tanjong Katong, the coastal area on eastern Singapore, was part of the land set aside by Raffles to be developed into a marine yard. By the 1860s, boat yards were proliferating there, which gave rise to related businesses such as boathouses and beachside resorts. Tanjong Katong became well-known for sea bathing, and numerous holiday villas were built by wealthy residents. The idyllic coconut groves and beach settings provided a quiet retreat from the bustling city life.
