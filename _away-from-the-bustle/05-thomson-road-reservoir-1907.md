Also known as the Impounding Reservoir, and later MacRitchie Reservoir, it was constructed through a generous donation by Chinese philanthropist, Tan Kim Seng, in 1857. The water intake tower and connecting bridge was a reflection of late 19th century technology and construction method, and has been identified as one of the landmarks to be conserved.
