# **Tropical Metropolis**
Singapore’s development into a major port has been closely linked to its strategic geographical location and natural deep-water harbour. With the establishment of Singapore as a trading port in 1819, the mouth of the Singapore River functioned as a harbour at which ships called. Thus, the city’s earliest thoroughfare developed around this area, with Collyer Quay and the north banks of the river being the first business and civic centre. The first streets such as High Street, North Bridge Road and South Bridge Road were laid out here.  This section features selected scenes and landmarks of the historic city centre.
