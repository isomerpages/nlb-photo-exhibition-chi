Contrary to the common belief that Singapore was a quiet fishing town before the 19th century, studies have shown that the history of Singapore could be traced back to at least the 14th century, where a flourishing trading settlement already existed. Strategically situated on maritime trade routes, Singapore was ruled by a number of rulers, including Parameswara, the Malacca Sultanate and Johor Sultanate, before the British arrived and made Singapore a trading post, followed by a colony in the 19th century.

While the Malay royalty continued to reside at lavish palaces in Singapore during the 19th century, the British also established their presence by building a Government House on Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill), which was exclusive to the royalty in the past. The Government House was the residence of colonial governors until the 1850s, where the House was demolished to construct an artillery fort, and the hill was renamed Fort Canning Hill, which remains an important landmark in Singapore today.

Fort Canning Hill, previously known as Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill) and Government Hill, has been a landmark in Singapore's earliest recorded history. A bungalow was built after Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in 1819, which became known as the Government House, and was the residence of subsequent colonial governors until the 1850s when the Fort was built. The entrance to Fort Canning consisted of a main gate with its distinctive Gothic archway located at the north side of the hill.

Fort Canning is believed to be the site of a palace for Malayan royalty and a burial ground for ancient kings in the past. A bungalow was built in early 19th Century, which became known as the Government House, and was the residence of subsequent colonial governors until the 1850s when the Fort was built. In 1859, Government House was demolished to make way for an artillery fort. The Fort had never been used in any battle though.

Fort Canning Hill has always been an important landmark in Singapore's history. This photograph shows a view of the town taken around 1879 from the saluting battery on Fort Canning Hill, the cannons fired at the battery were to signal the time of day and alert the town to fires. The Raffles Institution can be seen on the extreme left and the St. Andrew's Cathedral can be seen in the middle of the photograph.

Boat Quay, a river embankment on the south bank of the Singapore River, is one of the oldest and most historical areas in Singapore’s central region. For more than 150 years, warehouses thriving with economic activity lined the banks of north and south Boat Quay. This photograph shows rows of sampan (small wooden boats used to ferry passengers and goods across short distances on rivers) anchored at Boat Quay in the foreground, against the backdrop of Fort Canning.

After the old Government House on Government Hill (now Fort Canning) was torn down in 1859, a new Government House was completed in 1869. The Government House was the official residence for colonial governors, housing a total of 21 governors during colonial rule in Singapore. In 1959 it was renamed Istana (“Palace” in Malay) when Singapore attained self-governance. It is currently the official residence for presidents of Singapore, located along Orchard Road, Singapore's prime shopping district.

Similar to much of Classical European architecture, Istana Kampong Glam was symmetrically planned, featuring classical elements such as round arches. Several features of traditional Malay architecture were also featured, aptly reflecting its function as the Sultan's palace.
