British traveller and writer Isabella Bird wrote of Singapore in 1879: ‘a city ablaze with colour and motley with costume…every Oriental costume from the Levant to China floats through the streets’. Early Singapore was a melting pot of cultures and one’s cultural identity was often apparent in the costumes he or she wore.  

In the days when photography was rare, having family or group portraits taken was usually reserved for special occasions or a privilege of the wealthy. The group portraits in this section thus present precious glimpses of the myriad of communities that once resided in Singapore. Whether impeccably dressed for the studio portrait, or in everyday clothes in their home environments, they reflect the rich tapestry of Singapore’s multi-cultural society.

When Singapore was founded in 1819, there were already thousands of Malays living on the island. They were soon joined by other immigrants from the Malay Peninsula, Riau, Sumatra, Java, Bawean, Sulawesi and other islands.  In the past, many Malays lived in kampongs or villages in the eastern part of Singapore such as this group in Changi.

The women here are wearing the distinctive Malay dress baju kurung which comprises of a knee-length tunic and a sarong. The infants, however, are dressed in Western dresses, which suggests the high social-economic status of the family.

The Indian Muslims or Jawi Peranakans are Straits-born Muslims of mixed Indian and Malay parentage who have assimilated into the Malay community. Their ancestors were mostly Tamil migrants from south India who settled in Malaya and married local Malay women. 

While sporting a traditional Malay songkok cap and a sarong, the man dons a Western jacket and leather shoes. The boy is clothed in full traditional baju kurong capped with a songkok.

The Straits Chinese, or Peranakans (‘local born’ in Malay), are descendants of Chinese immigrants who married local women of Malay/Indonesian heritage. Many trace their origins to 15th-century Malacca where their ancestors came to trade and settled. Peranakan culture is a hybrid of Chinese, Malay and Western elements. Many Straits Chinese became prominent businessmen or community leaders. Seen here is a wealthy family at their residence.

The traditional costume for Peranakan women is the nonya kebaya which comprises of an embroidered blouse paired with a batik sarong. Older women, like the one in the centre, would wear baju panjang (‘long dress’ in Malay), which is a knee-length tunic worn over a batik sarong. Peranakan men were early adopters of Western apparel, as evident in this photograph.

Large numbers of Chinese from Fujian, Guangdong provinces and Hainan island were driven by poverty in their homeland to seek a better life in Singapore. The waves of emigration occurred throughout the 19th century after Singapore’s founding and in the early 20th century. The majority came as unskilled labourers but there were also traders in search of business opportunities.  

Before 1911, Chinese in Singapore, especially those who were born in China, followed the dressing conventions of the Qing Dynasty. The man here sports a pigtail, even though his outfit is westernised. The woman, who wears a traditional tunic and pleated skirt, has tiny bound feet.

Large families were once common among the Singapore Chinese as traditionally a family with many off springs were considered desirable in a rural society.

Most of the men here are clothed in samfu, a two-piece attire comprising a shirt and a pair of trousers. This style of dressing was popular among Singapore Chinese right up to the mid-20th century.

Indians first came to Singapore in the early 19th century as labourers and the majority of them arrived from South India. Eventually, they settled here and came to dominate certain trades such as moneylending.

The man is wearing a dhoti, a traditional garment made from a long piece of cloth that is wrapped around the legs and knotted at the waist. The woman and the girl are wearing sarees, which is a piece of cloth draped around the lower body and carefully pleated and folded across the upper body.

While the majority of Indians were Hindus, there were also Christians and Muslims. This family is very likely Christian as the baby is dressed in a christening gown. All the males are in full western outfits while the women’s apparel is a combination of a saree and a western-style blouse.

The Eurasians are persons of mixed European and Asian lineage. The origins of Eurasians can be traced to the European traders, administrators and individuals who travelled to Asia between the 16th and 20th centuries and married local women. 

The apparel of this family is a mix of Western and Asian garments. While the rest of the family don Western outfits, the seated woman sports the baju panjang, which is the traditional costume of women in the Malay Archipelago.

The Europeans in Singapore were a small but powerful minority. British and Europeans of other nationalities came since the early 19th century to work for the colonial government, banks, trading houses and in other professions. 

The Europeans observed the dressing conventions of the time in their home countries despite the heat of the tropics. The family is seen here sporting Edwardian era attires. Many European households typically employed Chinese women as domestic helpers, known as ‘amahs’, as in the case of this family.
