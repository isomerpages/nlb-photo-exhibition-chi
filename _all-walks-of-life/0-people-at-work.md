The founding of Singapore as a British trading port in 1819 led to an influx of immigrants from China, India and the Malay Archipelago, who came in search of work opportunities arising from the colony’s rapid growth. People of different trades and socio-economic status arrived, from administrators and merchants to peddlars and labourers.

A large number of migrants from China and India came here as labourers, providing the much needed labour in building construction and various industries on the island. Among the indigenous Malays and others from the region, many worked as fishermen and farmers. Regardless of race, many migrants also worked as itinerant hawkers plying their trade from street to street. The Europeans came as administrators as merchants, working in government offices, banks and trading houses. They were later joined by English-educated locals working under them. The following images show people at work who contributed to the development of early Singapore.

Many impoverished Chinese migrants came to Singapore in the 19th century to work as coolies – indentured labourers who were employed in construction, agriculture, shipping, mining and other sectors. They formed the backbone of early Singapore’s labour force. Mostly engaged in unskilled, hard labour, coolies worked as under harsh circumstances. Coolies carrying cargo and commodities around the Singapore River was a common sight in the old days.

Originating from South India, Tamil coolies came to Singapore during the 19th century and generally worked at the docks and railway stations. In addition, Singapore also received Indian convicts, mainly from Bengal, Madras and Bombay, who served out their sentences while working as labourers. These convicts were a source of cheap labour needed for the construction of public roads, bridges and key public buildings in the early days.

Samsui women, with their trademark red or sometimes blue headdress, were female migrant workers mainly from Sanshui county of Guangdong Province, China. They arrived in Singapore since the 1930s in search of employment. Many found work as general labourers for the construction industry, in tin mines and rubber estates, while others became domestic servants in wealthy households.

Working as an itinerant street hawker was a common occupation among the unskilled early migrants as it required little capital. Seen here are Chinese street hawkers plying their trade outside Telok Ayer Market, now known as Lau Pa Sat (‘Old Market’) a well-known hawker centre. Hawkers who operated food carts and stalls were once a familiar sight. From the 1950s onwards, they were moved to more sanitary modern hawker centres which have become one of Singapore’s trademarks.

Hawkers were frequently found along busy streets and intersections, peddling cooked food, drinks, snacks, vegetables, poultry and sundries. Patrons to food hawkers would eat around the makeshift stalls often with little or no comfort.

The Malay satay man, with his portable charcoal grill, was common in Singapore up to the 1970s. Satay is made of dices of skewered meat – chicken, beef or mutton – that is grilled and eaten with peanut sauce.

The Indian hawker selling snacks was often seen carrying a basket containing his wares on his head. Selling bread and cakes or kacang puteh (assorted nuts in Malay), he plied his trade along pavements or outside cinemas.

Pepper and gambier were two of the most important crops grown in Malaya in the 19th century. The two crops were cultivated together as they complemented each other. Pepper had long been an export commodity of Southeast Asia and gambier was in high demand for dyeing and tanning cotton, wool, silk and leather. In the 1840s, there were 600 gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore employing thousands of Chinese labourers.

In the past, Singapore was known to have many fishing villages, mostly built along coasts and rivers. As a livelihood or an important source of income for many, fishing was usually done inshore with lightly built boats, or sampans.
