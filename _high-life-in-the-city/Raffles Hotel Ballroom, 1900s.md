Raffles Hotel was renowned for parties and banquets at its Ballroom, where guests could enjoy fine dining and dance to music performed by a live band. Menu cards from the 1910s showed that the dishes served included clear turtle soup, baked fish in butter gravy, grilled fillet steak, and roasted pheasant. In the 1930s, after-dinner dances took place at the Ballroom till midnight from Monday to Saturday.
