From the turn of the century until the 1960s, High Street was a popular shopping street for highbrow products. Many Sindhi and Sikh merchants set up family-owned textile shops here, which were well-known for their imported European fabrics such as laces and brocade, and fine tailoring. This street continued to be Singapore’s premier shopping belt till the 1960s, with department stores such as Aurora, Chotirmall and Metro attracting shoppers for quality merchandise.
