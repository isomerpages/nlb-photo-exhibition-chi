Raffles Hotel was established in 1887 by Armenian hoteliers, Sarkies brothers, and commenced operations as a 10-room hotel. Its seafront location made it very popular with European residents and travellers. When its new main building opened in 1899, it was among the earliest buildings in Singapore to have electric lighting and appliances. By the early 1900s, it had transformed into one of the largest grand hotels in Asia, renowned for its modern amenities and luxury.
