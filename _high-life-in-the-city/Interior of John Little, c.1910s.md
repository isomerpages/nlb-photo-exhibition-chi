This photograph shows the main stairs of John Little’s new three-storey building which was completed in 1910. It depicts the grandeur and elegance of Singapore’s then foremost department store. The new John Little store must have elevated shopping in Singapore to the next level, with its sprawling space of 3.5 acres filled with goods sourced from all over the world.
