Jewish businessman Nissim Nassim Adis bought over the Hotel de l’Europe in 1906 and rebuilt it at a cost of one million dollars. The rebuilt Grand Hotel de l’Europe was one of the best in Singapore, if not Asia, in the early 20th century. British novelist and biographer Horace Bleackley visited the Hotel in 1925, and claimed that its grill room was ‘the best restaurant probably in the continent of Asia’.
