The Capitol Theatre, which opened in 1930, was regarded as one of the finest cinemas of its time. Spanning more than 2,100 square metres, the design of the theatre drew inspiration from the Roxy Theatre in New York, following its seating arrangements, lighting and general plan. At its opening, the theatre was hailed as having the most modern auditorium with the largest capacity in Asia.
